# Protein Intake for Muscle Building

Protein is essential for muscle growth and recovery. Understanding how much you need and when to consume it can significantly impact your results.

## How Much Protein Do You Need?

**For muscle building**: 1.6-2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day (0.7-1g per pound)

Examples:
- 70 kg (154 lbs) person: 112-154g protein/day
- 80 kg (176 lbs) person: 128-176g protein/day
- 90 kg (198 lbs) person: 144-198g protein/day

## Protein Distribution

Research suggests spreading protein intake throughout the day is optimal:
- **Aim for 4-5 meals** with 25-40g protein each
- Each meal should include a complete protein source
- Post-workout protein is important but not magical - total daily intake matters most

## Best Protein Sources

**Animal-based** (complete proteins):
- Chicken breast: 31g per 100g
- Lean beef: 26g per 100g
- Eggs: 13g per 2 large eggs
- Greek yogurt: 10g per 100g
- Fish (salmon, tuna): 20-25g per 100g
- Whey protein powder: 20-25g per scoop

**Plant-based**:
- Lentils: 9g per 100g cooked
- Chickpeas: 19g per 100g
- Tofu: 8g per 100g
- Quinoa: 4g per 100g cooked
- Combine different sources for complete amino acid profile

## Timing Considerations

**Pre-workout**: Not critical, but 20-40g protein 2-3 hours before can support performance

**Post-workout**: Consume 20-40g protein within 2 hours after training. The "anabolic window" is wider than once thought.

**Before bed**: 30-40g slow-digesting protein (casein or Greek yogurt) can support overnight recovery

## Common Questions

**Can I absorb more than 30g per meal?**
Yes. The body can absorb much more, though 25-40g per meal is ideal for muscle protein synthesis.

**Do I need protein supplements?**
No, but they're convenient. Whole foods should be your primary protein source.

**More protein = more muscle?**
Only up to ~2.2g/kg. Beyond that provides no additional benefit for muscle growth.

## Protein Quality Matters

Complete proteins contain all essential amino acids. Leucine content is particularly important for muscle protein synthesis - aim for 2-3g leucine per meal.
