# Perfect Bench Press Form

The bench press is a compound exercise that primarily targets the chest, triceps, and front deltoids. Proper form is crucial for safety and effectiveness.

## Setup

1. **Lie on bench**: Eyes should be directly under the bar
2. **Grip width**: Slightly wider than shoulder-width (forearms vertical at bottom)
3. **Foot position**: Feet flat on floor, knees at 90 degrees
4. **Arch your back**: Create a small arch in lower back, shoulder blades pinched together
5. **Unrack**: Lift bar off rack and position over mid-chest

## The Movement

1. **Descent**:
   - Lower bar in controlled manner (2-3 seconds)
   - Bar should touch chest at nipple line
   - Elbows at 45-degree angle (not flared out to 90 degrees)
   - Keep forearms vertical throughout

2. **Bottom Position**:
   - Brief pause with bar touching chest
   - Maintain tension, don't bounce
   - Keep wrists straight

3. **Ascent**:
   - Drive bar up explosively
   - Press back slightly toward rack
   - Fully extend arms at top
   - Don't let bar drift forward

## Breathing

- Breathe in on the way down
- Hold breath during the press
- Exhale at the top or during the final third of the press

## Common Mistakes

1. **Bouncing bar off chest**: Dangerous and reduces muscle tension
2. **Flaring elbows**: 90-degree elbow angle puts excessive stress on shoulders
3. **Lifting butt off bench**: Reduces stability and can cause injury
4. **Not using full range of motion**: Bar should touch chest every rep
5. **Uneven bar path**: Bar should move in a slight arc, not straight up and down

## Progression Tips

- Start with just the bar (45 lbs) to master form
- Add 5 lbs per week for beginners
- Use a spotter for heavy sets
- Film yourself to check form
- If plateaued, try varying grip width or tempo
